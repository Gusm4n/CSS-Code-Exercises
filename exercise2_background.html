    <!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: Backgrounds
    In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to apply backgrounds to different sections of the layout.
    CSS can be placed in a separate file, in the <head> section of this document, or inline.

    Try these things:
    1) Go to subtlepatterns.com and select a pattern to apply to the background of the page.
       Make sure it repeats in all directions.

    2) Underline the underlined words by giving them a class and applying the style.

    3) Highlight the background of the highlighted text with the color "#ffff00"

    4) Center all of the text on the page

    Bonus points: Install a Google Font and update the fonts using two different faces.
