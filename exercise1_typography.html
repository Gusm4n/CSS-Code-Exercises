    <!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: Typography
    In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to update type styles. Try these things:

    1) Create some typographic hierarchy by styling the title, author, and paragraphs.

    2) Underline the highlighted words by giving them a class and applying the style.

    3) Center all of the text on the page

    Bonus points: Install a Google Font and update the fonts using two different faces.

      <div class="">
        <h1>Look for Me</h1>
        <h3>BY TED KOOSER</h3>

        <p>Look for me under the hood
        of that <div class="">old Chevrolet</div> settled in weeds
        at the end of the pasture.</p>

        <p>I'm the radiator that spent its years
        bolted in front of an engine
        <div class="">shoving me forward</div> into the wind.</p>

        <p>Whatever was in me in those days
        has mostly <div class="">leaked away</div>,
        but my cap's still screwed on tight</p>

        <p>and I know the names of all these
        tattered moths and <div class="">broken grasshoppers</div>
        the rest of you've forgotten.</p>
      </div>
