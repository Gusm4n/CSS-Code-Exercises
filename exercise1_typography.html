    <!-- THE ASSIGNMENT: Typography
    In this assignment, you'll want to use CSS to update type styles.
    CSS can be placed in a separate file, in the <head> section of this document, or inline.

    Try these things:
    1) Create some typographic hierarchy by styling the title, author, and paragraphs.

    2) Underline the underlined words by giving them a class and applying the style.

    3) Highlight the background of the highlighted text with the color "#ffff00"

    4) Center all of the text on the page

    Bonus points: Install a Google Font and update the fonts using two different faces.

      <div class="">
        <h1>Look for Me</h1>
        <h3>BY TED KOOSER</h3>

        <p>Look for me under the hood
        of that <div class="underline">old Chevrolet</div> settled in weeds
        at the end of the pasture.</p>

        <p>I'm the radiator that spent its years
        bolted in front of an engine
        <div class="underline">shoving me forward</div> into the wind.</p>

        <p>Whatever was in me in those days
        has mostly <div class="highlighted">leaked away</div>,
        but my cap's still screwed on tight</p>

        <p>and I know the names of all these
        tattered moths and <div class="underline">broken grasshoppers</div>
        the rest of you've forgotten.</p>
      </div>
